 <h2>Agtech Consultancy Services Goal</h2>
 <p>Increase food security and replace the import of expensive fresh food, while contributing to the development of the local economy and community.</p>
 <p>Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, however logistical, climatic and geographic challenges continue to reduce the availability of fresh, local food around the capital, Port Moresby. Farming is based on subsistence agriculture and lack of local production causes residents to rely on expensive imports for basic food items. The development of modern agriculture offers urban residents access to healthier, cheaper food, while diversifying the local economy and providing much needed employment.</p>
 <h2> The Vision</h2>
 <p>Build a profitable farm through the use of Technology that supports and employs the local community, improves food security and replaces food imports.</p>
 <p>By implementing technology to vertical integration of the production and supply chain, Agtech Coinsultancy Services has created an agriculture venture that brings the most advanced modern technologies and best practices to the entire production chain. High-level training, advanced greenhouse technology, and modern packaging, distribution,specif need ICT infrastructure together with software applications and marketing methods all ensure that any farm can become a financial success. Such a modern farming operation significantly increases the supply of fresh fruit and vegetables, reducing food insecurity, increasing employment, and promoting a future generation of entrepreneurial farmers.</p>
